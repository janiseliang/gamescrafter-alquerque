# Alquerque
## Rules
- Played on 5x5 board, and each player starts with 12 pieces
- Goal is to remove all of opponent's pieces from the board
- Can only move along lines
- Similar rules to checkers: capture by jumping over opponent's piece into empty square behind
- If a capture is possible, one must be made
- Multiple-jump captures are allowed, and required if possible

### Bell's additional rules
On top of the above rules, R.C. Bell gives additional rules:
- Cannot move pieces backwards, only laterally or forward
- A piece cannot move back to a square it has previously occupied (piece has memory?)
- If a piece has moved to the back row (furthest from player), it may only move to capture the opponent's pieces
- **Alternate win condition**: Win if opponent is unable to move any pieces (need to implement something for this, anyways)
